This is task-1 of my OASIS INFO BYTE STUDENT INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (OIBSIP). In this task, I have designd a landing page on the topic "YOUTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS" by using HTML.
 It aims to provide visitors with information on the subject and resources to seek help. The page have a header section with its main topic as heading. It includes sections that discuss the different mental illnesses that affect youth and the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for each. The page also provides links to resources. The page has been designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across different devices. Overall, the landing page aims to provide valuable information on youth and mental illness and connect visitors with resources that can help them get the assistance they need.
